==================
Bank Payment Tests
==================

This addon adds unit tests for the OCA Bank Payment project. Unless you are a
developer on this project, you do not need to install this module.

The reason to put theses tests in a separate module is that the functionality
that is being tested is split up into several modules that are not mutually
dependent on each other. This module contains all the necessary dependencies
for the tests to run.

Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/bank-payment/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
check there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,
help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.
